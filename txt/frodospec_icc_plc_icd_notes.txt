ICC Pseudocode
--------------
Using the Red VPH to position as an example:

- Set N10:0/0=1 (Red VPH to position)
- Enter loop
  - Read N20:7/0 (Red VPH/Grating in transit)
    - If true set red arm resolution status "in transit"
  - Read N20:7/2 (Red VPH in position)
    - If true red arm resolution status "high", exit loop (success)
  - Read N20:8 (Fault status)
    - If bit 3 is set exit loop propogating error

We may need to reset faults, either before the sequence starts or on an error, or on
a reboot/startup sequence , by setting N10:0/15=1
